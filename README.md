Hey! From on you are one of the Elite <0.000000003% people that will read this...EVER

If you came here by mistake...you will be one of them anyways ðŸ˜‘

I asked GitHub Support Team how you guys could get a badge to celebrate this achievement, they told me to write the details of the badge on a plain TXT file and drag and drop it on the recycle bin-like icon on my Desktop. It does sound fishy but the GitHub Team has assured me that this is my best shot at getting the badge...so rest assured.

For the record, I last dropped it on 7th April 2021.
